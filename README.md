# Web-Shop

## Personal Archives "Project"

This is a very old repository containg code written about 2-4 years ago (started 4+ years ago and "completed" 2 years ago - end of 2016). I've recently decided to take most of the repositories I have under private source 
control and publish to Github public repositories as a way of "releasing" them.

Because of the age of the project a lot of the descriptions bellow might not be quite acurate or full, especially the sections discussing current state and features.

## Build Status and Running

The project was built using a release candidate for ASP.NET Core 1.0 with the DNX tooling. This is now causing issues when trying to re-build run the solution on Visual Studio 2017.

So there might be some workarounds or extra effort needed to get it to build and run.

## The Blog Posts

The description of this project is covered in the following blog post from about two years ago (start of 2017):

[So, I've been building something for the past 2 years...](http://blog.emirosmanoski.mk/I-Have-Been-Building-For-2-Years/)

For any additional details you can visit that post. **Note**: De demo is currently not available!


Additionally some of the custom components used in the solution have been covered by different posts in more details:

1. [Entity Type Configuration Fluent API for Many to many relations](http://blog.emirosmanoski.mk/Entity-Type-Configuration-Many-To-Many-Relations/)
2.  [Generic Extension Methods and usage for Entity metadata information.](http://blog.emirosmanoski.mk/Generic-Extension-Methods/)
3. [Angular Hierarchy Data Directive](http://blog.emirosmanoski.mk/Angular-Tree-Data-Directive/)
4. [How I stopped worrying and learned to love the Gulp!](http://blog.emirosmanoski.mk/How-I-Stopped-worying-and-learned-to-love-the-Gulp/)

## What is not in the Blog Posts

First of all, the code of course! So feel free to explore and browse that.

Additionally everything under the `Documents` folder. Which is the initial mockups for most of the screens done using Balsamiq (included are pdf exports) and database diagrams covering some of the more intersting aspects like the generic product categorizations and dynamic propety definitions

## End Note
This is the project I used to learn a lot about AngularJs
